This work presents a framework to obtain reference-free combustion efficiency measurements in rotating detonation engines using a chemical balance model and a time-averaged H2O mole fraction. Because a time-resolved pressure measurement was not available, a new post-processing method was developed to estimate a time-averaged H2O mole fraction directly from time-resolved partial pressure measurements. The approach is demonstrated in an RDE with a 50% converging exit nozzle. Temperature and PH2O were measured *in-situ* at 1 MHz using a single-ended scanned-wavelength-modulation spectroscopy sensor. Results across a range of equivalence ratios ($\Phi$ $\approx$ 0.5 - 1.5)
 and mass flowrates (150–350 g/s) showed combustion efficiencies of 50–65%, with uncertainties between 14–16% for most cases. Clear trends were identified between combustion efficiency, equivalence ratio, and wave speed ratios (D/DCJ). This framework enables accurate characterization of energy conversion losses in RDEs and supports future performance optimization.
