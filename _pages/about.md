Welcome to my personal website. Here, I share selected research projects and open-source codes developed during my PhD research for use by the broader research community in personal and academic applications.

Bio
======

I earned my B.S. in Aerospace Engineering from UCLA in 2021, where I graduated *Summa Cum Laude* and received the departmental award for Outstanding B.S. in Aerospace Engineering. As an undergraduate, I conducted experimental research on the combustion dynamics of acoustically coupled micro-jet flames under the supervision of Professor Ann Karagozian. During my undergraduate studies at UCLA, I worked as a liquid rocket propulsion intern at the Air Force Research Laboratory through Sierra Lobo Inc., where I analyzed high-speed pressure and accelerometer data from large-scale propulsion tests and implemented physics-informed filtering techniques to improve assessment of combustion stability.

I began my doctoral studies in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan in September 2021, advised by Professor Mirko Gamba. My research focuses on quantifying energy conversion processes in rotating detonation combustors, with particular emphasis on combustion efficiency and deflagration loss mechanisms. My work leverages advanced laser diagnostic techniques such as tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy, reduced-order modeling, and traditional high-speed imaging and pressure transducers to interrogate the RDC flowfield.

In my free time I enjoy running, playing chess, watching football, and travelling!
